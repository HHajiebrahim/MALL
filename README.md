# Mall Algorithm

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Mall Algorithm for optimization problems. The algorithm simulates the behavior of customers and sellers in a mall to find the optimal solution to a given objective function.

## Problem Definition
The algorithm aims to minimize or maximize a given objective function. In this implementation, the objective function is defined in the `f_3.m` file.

## Algorithm Parameters
The algorithm parameters can be adjusted to fit the specific optimization problem. The main parameters include:
- **MaxIt**: Maximum number of iterations.
- **SellerPop**: Sellers population size.
- **CustomerPop**: Customers population size.
- **Opportunities**: Number of opportunities for customers.
- **RewardPunishment**: Value of reward and punishment.
- **alfa**: Inertia to target.
- **alfaCoef**: Inertia update coefficient.

## Usage
To use the Mall Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Define the objective function in a separate file (`f_3.m`).
2. Set the problem parameters in the `Mall.m` file.
3. Run the `Mall.m` script to find the optimal solution.

### Sample Function
A sample objective function, `f_3.m`, is provided to demonstrate how to define and use a custom objective function with the Mall Algorithm.

#### `f_3.m`
```matlab
function z = f_3(x)
    f=x(1)^2+1e6*sumsqr(x(2):x(end)); % Example: Cigar function
end
```
